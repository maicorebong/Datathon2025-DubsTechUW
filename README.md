# ðŸ›’ Ecommerce Data Pipeline and Analysis

## Objective
This project was developed for the 2025 DubsTech x UWashington Datathon and simulates a real-world BI and consulting workflow. Data from Modecraftâ€™s e-commerce platform was loaded from Azure Blob Storage into Snowflake, where it was transformed using SQL and Python in VS Code.

Analyses included product health scoring, RFM segmentation, and market basket insights. Results were written back to Snowflake and visualized in Tableau to highlight key revenue drivers and customer behavior.

The data architecture was designed to apply core tools and processes as part of a learning exercise and will be iterated over time to improve efficiency, scalability, and analytical depth. Additional analyses and architectural enhancements are planned as the project evolves.

### Step 1: Data Ingestion and Storage
Created a resource group and storage account, then uploaded the raw modecraft_online_retail.csv file to a blob container.

## Step 2: Staging
Configured Shared Access Signature (SAS) settings to enable secure and controlled access for data exchange from Azure. Set start and expiry date/time as needed and generate a SAS token. Set up external stage referencing SAS token from Azure container to Snowflake. [reference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-azure-config)
